<h2>Problem solving<h2/> 
<p> We as a team were given problems to solve together, the problem was about using Euler graph theory and Hamiltonian path to figure out the solution to enhance our ability in problem solving by understanding it. The core thought or the question to ask when it comes to these two theories are: 
	- Euler's graph theory: Abstracting the problem, simplifying and proving the solution.  
	- Hamiltonian path: Certain types of problem cannot be proved solvabled unless tried and solved.
Practically these types of problems makes us think in the direction of 'is the problems solvable or not?', to abstract and simplify to increase understanding of the problem and solve it. Hamiltonian paths makes to create a repository of solutions and face problems further by reference.

<h2>Mark-up language and group discussion<h2/>
<p> Markup language adds formatting and context information to a existing language through use of symbols. Commonly used mark-up languages are JSON, YAML, HTML, XML etc. In discussion of mark-up language and a group task to create our own markup language, there was a discussion about adding a specific feature to the language like grouping the content to the language. Critical thinking and reasoning elements were touched upon in the course of the discussion. Like any skill this builds on practise and takes a lot of effort and clarity of thought.

<h2>Culture talk - Freedom of choice<h2/>
<p> Freedom and rules inside our office culture was the topic of discussion. The core principle or thought behind the talk and discussion was 'Free choices are essential to a great culture and the rules that are present are to maximise the free choices for maximum people inside the culture'. 
	Freedom, free-choice and free-will are interesting topics for me as I am little familiar with philosophy. The role that interests or passion plays in our choices was something that I saw in a fresh light. One of the famous and dominant belief in the current world is the idea of 'Follow your heart'. In my understanding, it is just a part of the puzzle, Reasoning based on circumstances and oppurtunities is the remaining piece that makes it whole. That thought gave a little more clarity in that direction. The importance willful choices and the ability to see the consequences is also an important learning today, many times the actions that we take sub-consiously seem to ignore the consequences whether it be good or bad. In theory most know this but to retain and practise it is an entirely different thing which I think the office culture clearly teaches.
