# Words - foundational thoughts behind it 
	Words are the primary aspects of complex thoughts and ideas communication. Ideas are represented in words, abstracting it and performing operations on it is what further advance is made on any study or topic. Whether is be hard sciences or social sciences, this is common method that is adopted for research or study. In any field of study or science, knowing the terminology is not just for showing off but it is what communicates or forms the common ground for exchange and enhancement of ideas.   		


# Problem solving principles  - furthur thoughts 
One of the method of general problem solving is as follows: 
	- Understand the problem 
	- Identify the constraints 
	- List all possible operations 
	- Arrange operations to form a solution 
Tips and one set of steps in problem solving 
	- Focus on the place with higher constraints 
	- Trial and error method 
	- Breaking down the problem and synthesis 
	- Device a strategy 
		- Problem is solved 
		- All constraints are met 
		- Solution is formalised 
Mathematical thinking is the basis of formalising solutions for problems, this helps in reusing and solving the same type of problem.
