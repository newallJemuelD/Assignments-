Day 2 - Learning 

# Problem solving 
	This is one of the basic skills that enable us to excel in programming. One of the useful thought that I learnt today is that *Software repeats the solution for many or infinite times but Humans are one who finds solutions*. 
	The main steps that are involved in problem solving that we learnt today in this session: 
		- Understand the problem 
		- Identify the constraints 
		- List all possible operations that does not violate the constraints
		- Arrange the operations to form a solution 
	The way I approach the problem normally is start solving the problem without thinking or formulating thoughts to solve it in a sequence. Normally this results in being uninterested in solving the problem or being frustrated with trying to solve it after a certain number of attempts or time. If that is not the case I will start to find excuses to avoid the problem or run away from it. Delegating can be a good thing but avoiding responsibility and pushing the works to others is also a common pattern I observed in my behaviour. If we are aware of the proper method and avoid these pitfalls we will be able to solve any kind of problem quickly.
 	 The approach that I learnt today normally I practise it when I get very used to solving a specific type of problem in a subconscious manner. Knowing a subject or any skill for that matter for a long period of time builds the memory to certain level that creativity becomes an automatic progress that happens like magic. One aspect of creativity is mixing, combining and matching different ideas or solutions together to form an entirely new and innovative solution. There are many ways to solve a problem but that which is very beneficial is the most efficient solution and the way to acheive it is through innovation and breakthroughs. 
	Now knowing it in theory is one thing, practising it consistently and applying it is an entirely different thing. Regularly practising and training the mind to adopt to it is the key. In day to day life, it looks like this, creating a schedule and following it until getting used to the routine. Increasing the intensity of the routine to stretch beyond the beginner level and becoming more advanced. For example if it is typing ( typing in keyboard ) is the skill I want to practise, I can allocate specific time for practising typing daily in the keyboard. Difficulty can be slowly increased by first typing simple words and sentence then move on to more complex words and sentences. There are also specific software and websites that has built in difficulty levels and tasks that makes practise easier.  

# Practical tips and tricks 
	Some useful tips/tricks that I learnt in this session are: 
		- Look for the place with more constraints and less choice 
		- Trial and error method 
		- Breaking down the problem and put it back together 
	Understanding patterns and sequence then formulating a strategy based on that to solve a problem is one of the sub-skills and it also involves mathematical thinking in it.  
	As per my experience, only after getting used to a type of problem will I be able to solve any problem with efficiency. Eventhough experience is a good thing but when it comes to innovation and exploring new possibilities having a problem solving mindset is the key. In this fast paced world, speed and timely delivery is important. Adapting and evolving are characteristics of solutions that will last longer and has a big impact in the real world. Actions and solutions that are delayed are no solutions at all in certain aspects of life. When it comes to the broad stroke of things in the world it is as per the old saying *There is nothing new under the sky*, same things happen over and over again but when looked on with a magnifying glass, the details is where the real action happens. The Devil is in the details, for example transportation happend from the beginning of human history. We moved from place to place, but how we moved changed, from foot, to carts, to water,  to road vehicles, to rail, to air. Innovation happen in the detail level and this is where we will be proficient if we have a problem solving mindset. 
	Creating a pattern or a system and ensuring the working of it is the main part of the problem. Deconstructing, breaking down the problem will give us a glimpse of the inner working of the system, correcting the fault and putting it back together is problem solving. The major hurdles that stop from making progress in growing in this aspect is fear or laziness. The Fear of failing and in-action are predominant factors in my life that stops me from solving the problems. There are other factors too like being distracted with minor things and not focusing on the important stuff tends to make to solve the wrong problems which then results in the multiplying of the current problems. 
	Thinking, processing and acting in a faster cycle is one important aspect of problem solving. The steps keeps on changing but cultivating the ability to change quickly, displaying agility is the prime strength. As problems tend to be complex and juggling between things quicker is the effective way to solve problems.  

# Git - further learning 
	Git as I wrote in the previous article is a version control system. It is used to collabrate and access older versions in an effective way. The major steps or actions that was taught today are: 
		- Creating and initialising a local and remote repository 
		- Syncing the local and remote repository 
		- Updating the repository and saving the changes 
		- Using the saved changes and continuing to work on the same document 
	Local repository is the place in my computer where for example if I am writing a document, it is saved. It is locally available inside the machine and can be access by those who have access to my computer. Remote repository is the place in the internet where it will be saved. Github is a widely used version control system that has taken the default name of version control systems for itself. By using the github website, a remote repository can be created. Then by configuring the username and email in the local repository the local and remote repository can be synced together. There are specific commands to accomplish each step in this process. As beginners we faced many problems with wrong spellings of the commands or the navigating and creating folder structure using a terminal. 
	The normal way of working in the document, is to have a master or a main branch which will be the stable version of the document and when we want to change the document we create a new branch after creating the desired change then merge the documents together. Until we merge, small but significant changes can be saved to remote repository by a command called push. I am not mentioning the exact commands but the overall workflow from my perspective ( beginner perspective ), then after the work is done the branch can be merged and deleted. 
	Git is an integral of a programmers workflow and having a good grasp and understanding of it is essential. This is my cumulative learning about this topic that I find relevant till now about version control systems.
