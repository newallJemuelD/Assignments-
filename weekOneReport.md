	My learning from this week are ideas to acquire skills, a framework for solving problems and foundational thought behind words, communication etc. 
	Acquiring skills and stacking them is the method that yields result, every skill has sub-skills or divisions within them. Focusing on each aspect seperately will make it easy to learn and understand the process of skill building. One of the big hurdle when it comes to acquiring a new skill is lack of motivation or getting demotivated. Breaking skills down to minor ones and focusing one by one gives a sense of accomplishment and motivates to push further on.
	When it comes to problem solving, the mindset or framework in approaching it is what I learnt. Understanding the problem, constraints and arranging the possible operations or options in the best way possible is the key point in solving any problem. Also other major points are having a repository of solution for reference and analysing for the possibility or possible outcome of a solution are important. 
	Words conveys ideas or concepts in abstraction, any field that tells about the field and no progress happens without this process or idea. Understanding the concept starts with understanding the words, knowing the words is not just talking their language or just to show off but enables interchange and progression of ideas.
